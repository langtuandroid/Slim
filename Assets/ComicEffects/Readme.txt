Comic Effects Volume 1

Effects file location.

All the particle effects prefabs can be found in the Desktop Effects
and the Mobile Effects directories.  You will also find the Effects Demo 
in the demo folder along with some environment effects demos that were
not shown on the store page.

Usage

To use the particle prefabs in Unity, simply drag one out into the 
hierarchy view, or the scene view.  The particle prefabs do not auto 
remove themselves from the scene when done playing.  If you need this 
feature, Unity Standard Assets has a script that will accomplish this.

Usage with Pooling

All the effects in the kit are designed to work using the enable disable 
activation approach required for most pooling systems.  You may need to 
add a despawn script used by your pooling system on the each effects.
